# Markdown Table: Sortable

This plugin adds the ability to sort rendered tables by clicking on header.
Beside simple text and numeric sorting, it can also figure out some other types such as money with currency symbol, different date and time format.
It is based on the [sorttable](https://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/) script of Stuart Langridge with some minor changes.
You can check the [original post](https://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/) for some advanced usage.
